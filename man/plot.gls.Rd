\usage{
\method{plot}{gls}(x, form, abline, id, idLabels, idResType, grid, \dots)
}
\alias{plot.gls}
\arguments{
 \item{x}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{gls}"}, representing
   a generalized least squares fitted linear model.}
 \item{form}{an optional formula specifying the desired type of
   plot. Any variable present in the original data frame used to obtain
   \code{x} can be referenced. In addition, \code{x} itself
   can be referenced in the formula using the symbol
   \code{"."}. Conditional expressions on the right of a \code{|}
   operator can be used to define separate panels in a Trellis
   display. Default is \code{resid(., type = "p") ~ fitted(.) },
   corresponding to a plot of the standardized residuals versus fitted
   values, both evaluated at the innermost level of nesting.} 
 \item{abline}{an optional numeric value, or numeric vector of length
   two. If given as a single value, a horizontal line will be added to the
   plot at that coordinate; else, if given as a vector, its values are
   used as the intercept and slope for a line added to the plot. If
   missing, no lines are added to the plot.}
 \item{id}{an optional numeric value, or one-sided formula. If given as
   a value, it is used as a significance level for a two-sided outlier
   test for the standardized residuals. Observations with
   absolute standardized residuals greater than the \eqn{1 - value/2}
   quantile of the standard normal distribution are identified in the
   plot using \code{idLabels}. If given as a one-sided formula, its
   right hand side must evaluate to a  logical, integer, or character
   vector which is used to identify observations in the plot. If
   missing, no observations are identified.}
 \item{idLabels}{an optional vector, or one-sided formula. If given as a
   vector, it is converted to character mode and used to label the
   observations identified according to \code{id}. If given as a
   one-sided formula, its right hand side must evaluate to a vector
   which is converted to character mode and used to label the identified
   observations. Default is the innermost grouping factor.}
 \item{idResType}{an optional character string specifying the type of
   residuals to be used in identifying outliers, when \code{id} is a
   numeric value. If \code{"pearson"}, the standardized residuals (raw 
   residuals divided by the corresponding standard errors) are used;
   else, if \code{"normalized"}, the normalized residuals (standardized
   residuals pre-multiplied by the inverse square-root factor of the
   estimated error correlation matrix) are used. Partial matching of
   arguments is used, so only the first character needs to be
   provided. Defaults to \code{"pearson"}.}
 \item{grid}{an optional logical value indicating whether a grid should
   be added to plot. Default depends on the type of Trellis plot used:
   if \code{xyplot} defaults to \code{TRUE}, else defaults to
   \code{FALSE}.}
 \item{\dots}{optional arguments passed to the Trellis plot function.}
}
\description{
  Diagnostic plots for the linear model fit are obtained. The
  \code{form} argument gives considerable flexibility in the type of
  plot specification. A conditioning expression (on the right side of a
  \code{|} operator) always implies that different panels are used for
  each level of the conditioning factor, according to a Trellis
  display. If \code{form} is a one-sided formula, histograms of the
  variable on the right hand side of the formula, before a \code{|}
  operator, are displayed (the Trellis function \code{histogram} is
  used). If \code{form} is two-sided and both its left and
  right hand side variables are numeric, scatter plots are displayed
  (the Trellis function \code{xyplot} is used). Finally, if \code{form}
  is two-sided and its left had side variable is a factor, box-plots of
  the right hand side variable by the levels of the left hand side
  variable are displayed (the Trellis function  \code{bwplot} is used).
