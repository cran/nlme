    \item{Worker}{

\details{
  Data on an experiment to compare three brands of machines used in an
  industrial process are presented in Milliken and Johnson (p. 285,
  1992). Six workers were chosen randomly among the
  employees of a factory to operate each machine three times. The
  response is an overall productivity score taking into account the
  number and quality of components produced.}
