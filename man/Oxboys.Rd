\description{
  The \code{Oxboys} data frame has 234 rows and 4 columns.
}
\format{
  This data frame contains the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{Subject}{
      an ordered factor giving a unique identifier for each boy in
      the experiment
    }
    \item{age}{
      a numeric vector giving the standardized age (dimensionless)
    }
    \item{height}{
      a numeric vector giving the height of the boy (cm)
    }
    \item{Occasion}{
      an ordered factor - the result of converting \code{age} from a
      continuous variable to a count so these slightly unbalanced
      data can be analyzed as balanced.
    }
  }
}
\details{
  These data are described in Goldstein (1987) as data on the
  height of a selection of boys from Oxford, England versus a
  standardized age.
