\title{Extract lmList Fitted Values}
\usage{
\method{fitted}{lmList}(object, subset, asList, \dots)
}
\alias{fitted.lmList}
\arguments{
 \item{object}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{lmList}"}, representing
   a list of \code{lm} objects with a common model.
 }
 \item{subset}{an optional character or integer vector naming the
   \code{lm} components of \code{object} from which the fitted values
   are to be extracted. Default is \code{NULL}, in which case all
   components are used.
 }
 \item{asList}{an optional logical value. If \code{TRUE}, the returned
   object is a list with the fitted values split by groups; else the
   returned value is a vector. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
 }
 \item{\dots}{some methods for this generic require additional
    arguments.  None are used in this method.} 
}
\description{
  The fitted values are extracted from each \code{lm} component of
  \code{object} and arranged into a list with as many components as
  \code{object}, or combined into a single vector.
}
\value{
  a list with components given by the fitted values of each \code{lm}
  component of \code{object}, or a vector with the fitted values for all
  \code{lm} components of \code{object}.
