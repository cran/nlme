    \item{Team}{
      an ordered factor with levels

      an ordered factor with levels

\details{
  Hicks (p.180, 1993) reports data from an experiment on
  methods for firing naval guns. Gunners of three different physiques
  (slight, average, and heavy) tested two firing methods. Both methods
  were tested twice by each of nine teams of three gunners with
  identical physique. The response was the number of rounds fired per
  minute.}
