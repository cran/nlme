\name{corCAR1}
\title{Continuous AR(1) Correlation Structure}
\usage{
corCAR1(value, form, fixed)
}
\alias{corCAR1}
\arguments{
 \item{value}{the correlation between two observations one unit of time
   apart. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.2.}
 \item{form}{a one sided formula of the form \code{~ t}, or \code{~ t |
     g}, specifying a time covariate \code{t} and,  optionally, a
   grouping factor \code{g}. Covariates for this correlation structure
   need not be integer valued.  When a grouping factor is present in
   \code{form}, the correlation structure is assumed to apply only
   to observations within the same grouping level; observations with
   different grouping levels are assumed to be uncorrelated. Defaults to
   \code{~ 1}, which corresponds to using the order of the observations
   in the data as a covariate, and no groups.}  
 \item{fixed}{an optional logical value indicating whether the
   coefficients should be allowed to vary in the optimization, or kept
   fixed at their initial value. Defaults to \code{FALSE}, in which case
   the coefficients are allowed to vary.}
}
\description{
  This function is a constructor for the \code{corCAR1} class,
  representing an autocorrelation structure of order 1, with a
  continuous time covariate. Objects created using this constructor must
  be later initialized using the appropriate \code{Initialize}
  method.  
}
\value{
  an object of class \code{corCAR1}, representing an autocorrelation
   structure of order 1, with a continuous time covariate.
