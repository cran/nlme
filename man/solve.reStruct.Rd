\name{solve.reStruct}
\title{Apply Solve to an reStruct Object}
\usage{
\method{solve}{reStruct}(a, b, \dots)
}
\alias{solve.reStruct}
\arguments{
 \item{a}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{reStruct}"},
   representing a random effects structure and consisting of a list of
   \code{pdMat} objects.} 
 \item{b}{this argument is only included for consistency with the
   generic function and is not used in this method function.}
 \item{\dots}{some methods for this generic require additional
    arguments.  None are used in this method.} 
}
\description{
  \code{Solve} is applied to each \code{pdMat} component of \code{a},
  which results in inverting the positive-definite matrices they
  represent. 
}
\value{
  an \code{reStruct} object similar to \code{a}, but with the
  \code{pdMat} components representing the inverses of the
  matrices represented by the components of \code{a}.
