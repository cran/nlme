\title{Extract pdMat Formula}
\usage{
\method{formula}{pdMat}(x, asList, \dots)
}
\alias{formula.pdMat}
\arguments{
 \item{x}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{pdMat}"}, representing
   a positive definite matrix.}
 \item{asList}{logical.  Should the asList argument be applied to each
   of the components?  Never used.}
 \item{\dots}{some methods for this generic require additional
    arguments.  None are used in this method.} 
}
\description{
  This method function extracts the formula associated with a
  \code{pdMat} object, in which the column and row names are specified.
}
\value{
  if \code{x} has a \code{formula} attribute, its value is
  returned, else \code{NULL} is returned.

\note{
  Because factors may be present in \code{formula(x)}, the
  \code{pdMat} object needs to have access to a data frame where the
  variables named in the formula can be evaluated, before it can resolve
  its row and column names from the formula.
