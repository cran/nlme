\usage{
Names(object, \dots)
Names(object, \dots) <- value
}
\alias{Names}
\alias{Names<-}
\arguments{
 \item{object}{any object for which names can be extracted and/or assigned.}
 \item{\dots}{some methods for this generic function require additional
   arguments.}
 \item{value}{names to be assigned to \code{object}.}

\description{
  This function is generic; method functions can be written to handle
  specific classes of objects. Classes which already have methods for
  this function include: \code{formula}, \code{modelStruct},
  \code{pdBlocked}, \code{pdMat}, and \code{reStruct}.
}
\value{
  will depend on the method function used; see the appropriate documentation.

\section{SIDE EFFECTS}{
  On the left side of an assignment, sets the names associated with
  \code{object} to \code{value}, which must have an appropriate length. 
}
\note{
  If \code{names} were generic, there would be no need for this generic
  function.
