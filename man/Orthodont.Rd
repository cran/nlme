\title{Growth curve data on an orthdontic measurement}
\description{
    The \code{Orthodont} data frame has 108 rows and 4 columns of the
    change in an orthdontic measurement over time for several young subjects.
}
\format{
    This data frame contains the following columns:
    \describe{
	\item{distance}{
	    a numeric vector of distances from the pituitary to the
	    pterygomaxillary fissure (mm).  These distances are measured
	    on x-ray images of the skull.
	}
	\item{age}{
	    a numeric vector of ages of the subject (yr).
	}
	\item{Subject}{
	    an ordered factor indicating the subject on which the
	    measurement was made.  The levels are labelled \code{M01}
	    to \code{M16} for the males and \code{F01} to \code{F13} for
	    the females.  The ordering is by increasing average distance
	    within sex.
	}
	\item{Sex}{
	    a factor with levels
	    \code{Male} and
	    \code{Female} 
	}
    }
}
\details{
    Investigators at the University of North Carolina Dental School
    followed the growth of 27 children (16 males, 11 females) from age 8
    until age 14.  Every two years they measured the distance between the
    pituitary and the pterygomaxillary fissure, two points that are easily
    identified on x-ray exposures of the side of the head.
