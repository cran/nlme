\title{Plot a ranef.lmList Object}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ranef.lmList}(x, form, grid, control, \dots)
}
\alias{plot.ranef.lmList}
\arguments{
 \item{x}{an object inheriting from class
   \code{"\link{ranef.lmList}"}, representing the estimated coefficients or
   estimated random effects for the \code{lmList} object from which it was
   produced.
 } 
 \item{form}{an optional formula specifying the desired type of plot. If
     given as a one-sided formula, a \code{dotplot} of the estimated
     random effects (coefficients) grouped according to all combinations of
     the levels of the factors named in \code{form} is returned. Single
     factors (\code{~g}) or crossed factors (\code{~g1*g2}) are
     allowed. If given as a two-sided formula, the left hand side must
     be a single random effects (coefficient) and the right hand side
     is formed by covariates in \code{x} separated by \code{+}. A
     Trellis display of the random effect (coefficient) versus the named
     covariates is returned in this case. Default is \code{NULL}, in
     which case  the row names of the random effects (coefficients) are
     used.}
 \item{grid}{an optional logical value indicating whether a grid should
   be added to plot. Only applies to plots associated with two-sided
   formulas in \code{form}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
 \item{control}{an optional list with control values for the
     plot, when \code{form} is given as a two-sided formula. The control
     values are referenced by name in the \code{control} list and  only
     the ones to be modified from the default need to be
     specified. Available values include: \code{drawLine}, a logical
     value indicating whether a \code{loess} smoother should be added to
     the scatter plots and a line connecting the medians should be added
     to the boxplots (default is \code{TRUE}); \code{span.loess}, used
     as the \code{span} argument in the call to \code{panel.loess}
     (default is \code{2/3}); \code{degree.loess}, used as the
     \code{degree} argument in the call to \code{panel.loess} (default
     is \code{1}); \code{cex.axis}, the character expansion factor for
     the x-axis (default is \code{0.8}); \code{srt.axis}, the rotation
     factor for the x-axis (default is \code{0}); and \code{mgp.axis}, the
     margin parameters for the x-axis (default is \code{c(2, 0.5, 0)}).}
 \item{\dots}{optional arguments passed to the Trellis \code{dotplot}
   function.
 } 
}
\description{
  If \code{form} is missing, or is given as a one-sided formula, a
  Trellis dot-plot of the random effects is generated, with a different
  panel for each random effect (coefficient). Rows in the dot-plot are
  determined by the \code{form} argument (if not missing) or by the row
  names of the random effects (coefficients). If a single factor is
  specified in \code{form}, its levels determine the dot-plot rows
  (with possibly multiple dots per row); otherwise, if \code{form}
  specifies a crossing of factors, the dot-plot rows are determined by
  all combinations of the levels of the individual factors in the 
  formula. The Trellis function \code{dotplot} is used in this method
  function.

  If \code{form} is a two-sided formula, a Trellis display is generated,
  with a different panel for each variable listed in the right hand side
  of \code{form}. Scatter plots are generated for numeric variables and
  boxplots are generated for categorical (\code{factor} or
  \code{ordered}) variables. 
}
\value{
  a Trellis plot of the estimated random-effects (coefficients) versus
  covariates, or groups.
