\title{Calculate lmeStruct Residuals}
\usage{
\method{residuals}{lmeStruct}(object, level, conLin, lmeFit, \dots)
}
\alias{residuals.lmeStruct}
\arguments{
 \item{object}{an object inheriting from class \code{"\link{lmeStruct}"},
   representing a list of linear mixed-effects model components, such as
   \code{reStruct}, \code{corStruct}, and \code{varFunc} objects.}
 \item{level}{an optional integer vector giving the level(s) of grouping
   to be used in extracting the residuals from \code{object}.  Level
   values increase from outermost to innermost grouping, with
   level zero corresponding to the population fitted values.  Defaults to
   the highest or innermost level of grouping.}
 \item{conLin}{an optional condensed linear model object, consisting of
   a list with components \code{"Xy"}, corresponding to a regression
   matrix (\code{X}) combined with a response vector (\code{y}), and
   \code{"logLik"}, corresponding to the log-likelihood of the
   underlying lme model.  Defaults to \code{attr(object, "conLin")}.}
 \item{lmeFit}{an optional list with components \code{beta} and \code{b}
   containing respectively the fixed effects estimates and the random
   effects estimates to be used to calculate the residuals.  Defaults
   to \code{attr(object, "lmeFit")}.}
 \item{\dots}{some methods for this generic accept optional arguments.}
}
\description{
  The residuals at level \eqn{i} are obtained by subtracting the fitted
  values at that level from the response vector.  The fitted values at
  level \eqn{i} are obtained by adding together the population fitted
  values (based only on the fixed effects estimates) and the estimated
  contributions of the random effects to the fitted values at grouping
  levels less or equal to \eqn{i}.
}
\value{
  if a single level of grouping is specified in \code{level},
  the returned value is a vector with the residuals at the desired
  level; else, when multiple grouping levels are specified in
  \code{level}, the returned object is a matrix with
  columns given by the residuals at different levels.
