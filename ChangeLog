	* man/corFactor.corStruct.Rd: Added an alias for
	corFactor.corNatural

	* src/nlmefit.c (internal_loglik): Changed the return value on
	error from R_NegInf to -DOUBLE_XMAX so the optif[09] optimizers
	will work properly.

	* src/corStruct.c (corStruct_factList): Provided a correct call to
	the R version of F77_CALL(chol) here and everywhere else in this
	source file.

	* R/zzz.R: Removed the deprecated call to provide

	* added many data sets

	* incorporated patches from Brian Ripley to use optim for the
	optimization rather than nlm
	
	* src/nlmefit.c (internal_loglik): Returned R_NegInf instead of
	generating a error on a singular precision matrix.

	* DESCRIPTION (Depends): Changed Depends to R version 1.0.1
	because of problem with assigning components of lists.
